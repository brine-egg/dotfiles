# Brine's personal dotfiles **UNTESTED**

Used by me for backing up/syncing configurations, mostly for CLI tools in ZSH.
*Use at your own risk*

## Installation

First make sure the following packages are installed:
- Git
- Stow
- Tmux

And clone the following plugin managers:
- [Miniplug](https://git.sr.ht/~yerinalexey/miniplug)
- [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)

Then clone the repo and run Stow:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/brine-egg/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles && stow .
```

If this command seems way too long, it is. However, I have **ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE** how to fix it soooo...
