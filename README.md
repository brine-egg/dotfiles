## Usage

Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/) through the [Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

Install [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) through one of the methods listed in [the manual](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml#ch-installation)

Make sure you have Git installed on your system, then run the following line of commands to clone the repo, remove the autogenerated home.nix file, then symlink the one inside the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brine-egg/dotfiles $HOME/.dotfiles && rm $HOME/.config/home-manager/home.nix && ln -s $HOME/.dotfiles/home.nix $HOME/.config/home-manager/home.nix
```

## Credits

This repo contains files from the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) project used for applying the colour theme across several programs.
The [Miniplug](https://sr.ht/~yerinalexey/miniplug/) Zsh plugin manager is embedded inside this repo, as I use it to install and update Zsh plugins.
